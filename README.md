# My Journey to complete the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge
  
This repository coovers my learning and development process to create a submission for the [Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification).
  
I decided to teach myself to develop Machine Learning & Deep Learning models as part of a summative assessment for one of my Level 1 Computer Science modules at Durham University. (COMP1101 - Programming)
  
### Repository Contents:
  
* __dataSample:__ This folder contains 2 samples of the Malware provided with the dataset for the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge. [Data Citation - https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10135](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10135)
  
* __Kaggle ML Tutorials:__ This folder contains my notes and code from following the [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) courses listed below:
  
    * [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
    * [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
    * [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)
    * [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)
    * [Natural Language Processing](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/natural-language-processing)
  
__NB: Parts of my notes are directly copied from the Kaggle Learn courses. All rights reserved to Kaggle and the course instructors.__
  
* __files:__ This folder contains any images used in my notes for the Kaggle Learn courses.
  
  
## Latest Update:
  
I have now submitted the summative assessment which looked at how I developed my skills in data science using the Kaggle Learn courses. The next stage is to begin __Feature Analysis and Engineering__ for the Malware Classification Challenge Dataset. I have prepared my personal drive on the __Nvidia Cuda Cluster__ at Durham University with the complete training and testing datasets.
  
__** There will be a pause in the progress of this journey during exam season. However, I will continue once all my exams are over.__
